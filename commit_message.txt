feat: Implement modern IPC service architecture and project cleanup

## Major Changes
- Add modern IPC service implementation (xmusic_service.h/cpp)
- Replace deprecated IPC API calls with current libnx patterns
- Create comprehensive test client for IPC verification
- Fix compiler warnings and clean up project structure

## New Features
- Threaded IPC service with command handling (Play/Pause/Volume/Status)
- Automated build system for both sysmodule and test client
- Comprehensive testing documentation and procedures
- Organized project structure with docs/ directory

## Technical Improvements
- Clean compilation with zero warnings
- Enhanced Makefile with test and install targets
- Updated .gitignore for proper build artifact exclusion
- Removed legacy/obsolete files and build scripts

## Build Status
✅ Sysmodule: 75KB, clean compilation
✅ Test Client: 660KB, clean compilation
✅ Audio engine preserved with startup melody
✅ Ready for hardware testing
